6. Governing Law/Jurisdiction.
A. Governing Law/Jurisdiction. These terms will be governed by the Laws of the State of California, USA
B. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Services or these Terms (collectively, “Dispute”), you and we agree to the following resolution process with respect to the Dispute. To most efficiently resolve any Dispute, you and we agree to first discuss the Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days. To do so, the party who wants to raise the Dispute must first send to the other party a notice that must include (1) a description of the Dispute and (2) a proposed resolution (together, the “Dispute Notice”). If you want to raise a Dispute, you must send your Dispute Notice by certified mail to us at: Calm Island Co Ltd , Korea. If we would like to subsequently discuss your Dispute Notice with you, we will contact you by using contact information included with your Dispute Notice. If we want to raise a Dispute, we will send our Dispute Notice to you at the email address we have on file for you. If we do not have a valid email address on file for you, we will send our Dispute Notice to you through a means that complies with the service of process rules in the state of California.
If you and Company do not reach an agreed-upon resolution within 30 days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, you and Company agree that the Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. In resolving the Dispute, the arbitrator will consider applicable law, the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and any facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, using JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service to which you and we consent.
(i) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator will resolve the submitted Dispute and can issue a decision consistent with this Section 6. However, WITH ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY; THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES; AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 6 to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.
(ii) Small Claims Matters Are Excluded. Either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes in small claims court.
C. Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6 will not apply to any legal action taken by either party to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in conjunction with any intellectual property claim or claim related to unauthorized access to data through the Services (including, but not limited to, claims related to patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets, and claims relating to the access or retrieval of data through the Services using an automated process such as scraping).
D. Timing of Claim. To help resolve any issues between you and us promptly and directly, you and Company agree that any Dispute Notice must be sent, or that any small claims or injunctive relief complaint permitted under this Section 6 must be filed, within one year after the events giving rise to the Dispute arise; otherwise, the Dispute is waived.
E. No Class Actions. You and Company agree that any Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.

8. Limitations of Liability.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY COMPANY PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including personal injury or death or for any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages that are directly or indirectly related to:

The foregoing limitations of liability will apply even if any of the events or circumstances were foreseeable and even if Company Parties were advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses or damages, regardless of whether you bring an action of contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort (including whether caused, in whole or in part, by negligence, force majeure, telecommunications failure, or destruction of the Services).
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages of the sort that are described above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO US DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION.', '3.

If you and Company do not reach an agreed-upon resolution within 30 days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, you and Company agree that the Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. In resolving the Dispute, the arbitrator will consider applicable law, the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and any facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, using JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service to which you and we consent.
(i) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator will resolve the submitted Dispute and can issue a decision consistent with this Section 6. However, WITH ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY; THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES; AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 6 to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.
(ii) Small Claims Matters Are Excluded. Either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes in small claims court.
C. Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 6 will not apply to any legal action taken by either party to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in conjunction with any intellectual property claim or claim related to unauthorized access to data through the Services (including, but not limited to, claims related to patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets, and claims relating to the access or retrieval of data through the Services using an automated process such as scraping).
D. Timing of Claim. To help resolve any issues between you and us promptly and directly, you and Company agree that any Dispute Notice must be sent, or that any small claims or injunctive relief complaint permitted under this Section 6 must be filed, within one year after the events giving rise to the Dispute arise; otherwise, the Dispute is waived.
E. No Class Actions. You and Company agree that any Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
